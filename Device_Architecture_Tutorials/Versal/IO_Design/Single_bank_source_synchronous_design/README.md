<h1>Single-Bank Source Synchronous Design</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

In the single-bank source synchronous reference design, six XPHY nibbles of the XPIO bank are used. Each XPHY nibble contains six XPHY NIBBLESLICEs that can transmit and receive data from six individual I/O pins. The transmit clock can be forwarded from the transmit core
either by the clock forward pins or by the transmit data pins from the bank. In this design, the transmit clock is forwarded by the clock forward pins. Because the design uses the LVDS  standard for the I/Os, data and clock are available in pairs of I/O pins.

The wizard configures clocking circuitry using an XPLL that is needed to support these configurations. The VCK190 board provides fixed and variable clock sources for the Versal device and other function blocks. Refer to the VCK190 Evaluation Board User Guide (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/vck190/ug1366-vck190-eval-bd.pdf">UG1366</a>) to understand the clock generation and clock sources available on the board. This tutorial design uses the
clocking wizard to generate a clock source from the on-board programmable LPDDR4 SI570 Clock2. It in turn provides the clock from its CLKOUT1 port to the XPLL.CLKIN port of the TX and RX cores
used for source synchronous applications. CLKOUT1 is set to provide a clock of frequency 225 MHz when configuring the wizard.

The reference design uses the PRBS generator and checker to exercise the I/Os. The design files for the PRBS generator and checker are provided in the design suite. The generator and checker are instantiated in the top-level file. The PRBS generator generates the data and feeds the TX core, which serializes it and transmits it to the RX core via an external loopback cable/card.
This tutorial uses the FMC XM107 loopback card. The RX core feeds the data to the PRBS checker after deserializing it. The checker flags an error if it detects any mismatch. The block diagram of the reference design is shown in the following figure. The transmit clock is generated by feeding a 01010101 pattern to the corresponding clock forwarding pins.

<h2>Clock Source (clock_gen) Setup</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

The VCK190 board has an I2C programmable SI570 low-jitter 3.3V LVDS differential oscillator
(U3) connected to the GC inputs of U1 LPDDR4_2 interface bank 705. The LPDDR4_CLK2_P
and LPDDR4_CLK2_N series capacitor coupled clock signals are connected to XCVC1902 ACAP
U1 pins AW27 and AY27, respectively. At power-up, this clock defaults to an output frequency
of 200.000 MHz. User applications or the system controller can change the output frequency
within the range of 10 MHz to 945 MHz through the I2C bus interface. Power cycling the
VCK190 board reverts this user clock to the default frequency of 200.000 MHz. This design uses
the onboard oscillator to provide PLL clock inputs to the Clocking Wizard. This core
generated using the clocking wizard in turn provides its output clock (set to 225 MHz) on port CLKOUT1 to the Advanced I/O Wizard TX (Bank 706)
and Advanced I/O Wizard RX (Bank 707) cores.
The bank0_pll_clkin ports of the TX and RX cores is driven by this CLKOUT1 which acts as the PLL
input clocks to these cores.

Follow the steps below to generate the core that will provide the PLL input clock to the TX and
RX cores. See the figures in this section for reference.

1. To start generating this core, open the IP catalog and search for Clocking Wizard. Double-click **Clocking Wizard** from the catalog to open the Customize IP window.

2. For Component Name, enter clock_gen, which is used in the reference
design.

  **Note**: The component name should match the module name used in the top-level design.

3. Under the Clocking Features Tab, for the clocking primitive select **MMCM**.

4. On the same tab, set the input clock information as shown in the figure:

    a. Input Clock: Primary

    b. Port Name: clk in1

    c. Input Frequency(MHz): 200

    d. PLL Input Clock Frequency: 200 (This is important because the on-board clock defaults to 200 MHz.)

    e. Source: Differential clock capable pin

</p>

5. In the Output Clocks tab, set the following:

    a. Output Clock: clk_out1

    b. Port Name: clk_out1

    c. Output Freq (MHz) Requested: 225

    d. Phase (Degrees) Requested: 0.000

</p>    

6. Under the MMCM Settings Tab, set the following:    
    a. Check the Allow Override Mode box

    b. Bandwidth: Low

    c. CLKFBOUT_MULT: 18

    d. CLKFBOUT_PHASE: 0

    e. COMPENSATION: AUTO

    f. DIVCLK_DIVIDE: 1

    g. CLKOUTFB_PHASE_CTRL: None

    h. In the second table, set Divide: 16

    i. Duty Cycle: 0.500

    j. Phase: 0.000

    Refer to the Versal ACAP Clocking Resources Architectural Manual (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/architecture-manuals/am003-versal-clocking-resources.pdf">AM003</a>) to understand how Fvco and Fclkout is calculated.
    Also, refer to the Versal AI Core Series Data Sheet (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds957-versal-ai-core.pdf">DS957</a>) to follow the limits for Fvco.

      Fvco = Fclkin × M/D

      Fclkout = Fclkin × M/(D*O)

      Where M is CLKFBOUT_MULT, D is DIVCLK_DIVIDE, and O is Divide from the values set previously.
      In this tutorial design, Fclkin = 200 MHz. Thus, Fvco = 3600 MHz and Fclkout = 225 MHz.

<h2>Introduction to Deserialization and Data Reception</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

<h3>Data Reception</h3>

In this source synchronous design, the capture clock is the same as the transmit clock which is
looped back externally via a loopback card on the board from the TX to the RX core. The transmit
clock is forwarded with the data by the TX core. The clock-to-data relation in this design is center
alignment as shown in the following figure. The capture clock should be received on the package pin
pair assigned in the constraints file. It should be received on NIBBLESLICE[0] because it is the only
NIBBLESLICE that has clock forwarding abilities.

The XPLL in the RX core needs a PLL input clock that is used by the XPHY for calibration (BISC).
In the design, the PLL input clock is received on the bank0_pll_clkin port of the
RX core instantiated by the wizard. CLKOUT1 of clock_gen is used to provide the input PLL clock
to the RX core on bank0_pll_clkin port.

The data received at the RX core interface is forwarded through the bank instance to the
programmable logic where it gets checked by the PRBS checker.

<h3>Configure and Generate an RX Advanced I/O Wizard Core</h3>
<h4>Generating an RX Core</h4>

After following the previous steps to generate the top-level design and clock source core,
the next step is to generate TX and RX cores for operation. Follow these steps to generate the
RX core using the AIOW. See the figures in this section for reference.

1. To start generating a core for the RX, open the IP catalog and search for Advanced I/O Wizard.
Double-click **Advanced I/O Wizard** from the catalog to open the Customize IP window.

2. For Component Name, enter Rx_1bank_ssync_intrfce, which is used in the reference
design.

 **Note**: The component name should match the module name used in the top-level design.

3. In the Basic Tab, set Application to **SOURCE SYNCHRONOUS** from the drop-down list.
Set Bus Direction to **RX ONLY**.

4. On the same tab, set the following:

    a. Interface Speed: 1800 Mb/s

    b. PLL Clock Source: Fabric(Driven by BUFG)

    c. PLL Input Clock Frequency: 225

    d. Clock Data Relation: Center DDR

    e. RX Serialization Factor: 8

    f. Select **Include PLL in Core**

    g. The remaining options can be set to the default.

</p>

5. In the Advanced tab, set the following:

    a. Select **REDUCE CONTROL SIGNALS** and **Enable BLI logic**.
       When BLI logic is enabled, the BLI registers between fabric and XPHY can be used to
       help with timing closure.

    b. Differential I/O Std: LVDS15.

    c. Number of Banks: 1 (because this is a single-bank design).

</p>    

6. In the Pin Configuration tab, make an entry in the table for the data with the capture clock. Sixteen pairs for data are configured under this tab. When selecting 16 pairs for data, the
   wizard adds 1 pair for the capture clock.    

  *  Data and the Strobe Setting

      - Pin Direction = RX

      - I/O Type = Differential
      - Signal Type = Data
      - Strobe I/O Type = Differential
      - Strobe Name = strobe

8. Click **OK** after reviewing the settings. The IP is now customized, and the Generate the Output Products prompt appears. Set the Synthesis Option to **Out of context per IP** and click **Generate to launch the design run** for the newly generated RX core. The default placement might look different but this does not matter because the default placement is adjusted later based on the pin locations in the
constraints file.

<h3>Receiver Design Considerations</h3>

This RX core is set up to work for a data rate of 1800 Mb/s. Also, the core is configured for
LVDS15 in the reference design. This single-bank design is configured for a center-aligned DDR system.
An XPIO bank has 54 pins, and this design uses 34 pins in the form of 16 pairs of data pins and one pair of capture clock pins. The design constrains the ports for the receive interfaces, and the wizard
takes care of the placement.

<h2>Introduction to Serialization and Data Transmission</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

<h3>Data Transmission</h3>

In the reference design, the TX core sends out the transmit clock via the clock forward pins. The data in
this design is generated using the PRBS generator. The transmit clock is generated by feeding
the pattern 01010101 to the clock forwarding pins. The data generated by the PRBS generator
is fed into the TX core from the programmable logic, which follows the TX datapath through a
serializer and output delay within the PHY. The serializer supports 8:1, 4:1, and 2:1 serialization.
In the design, an 8:1 serialization factor is used. The data is transmitted through the TX data pins
of the core. To understand the data flow operation inside the TX core, see Versal ACAP SelectIO
Resources Architecture Manual (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/architecture-manuals/am010-versal-selectio.pdf">AM010</a>).

The PLL input clock to the TX core is fed to the XPLL through a bank0_pll_clkin port. In the design,
the PLL input clock from the CLKOUT1 port of the clock_gen core is received on the bank0_pll_clkin port
of the TX core instantiated by the wizard. The transmit clock can be forwarded either through the data
pins or the clock forwarding pins on the TX core. This design uses the clock forwarding pins to
support the center DDR alignment. The wizard provides an option to set the phase on the
forwarded clock to 90, which aligns the data-to-clock relation to support the center DDR on the
RX core. The transmit clock is transmitted on NIBBLESLICE[0] and NIBBLESLICE[1] to the RX
core.

<h3>Configure and Generate a TX Advanced I/O Wizard Core</h3>

8. Click **OK** after reviewing the settings. The IP is now customized and the Generate the Output
Products prompt appears. Set the Synthesis Option to **Out of context per IP** and click **Generate** to launch the design run for the newly generated TX core. The default placement might look different,
but this does not matter because the default placement is adjusted later based on the pin locations in the constraints file.

<h3>Transmitter Design Considerations</h3>

This TX core is set up for a data rate of 1800 Mb/s. Also, the core is configured and tested for
LVDS15 in the reference design. This single bank design uses the clock from the CLKOUT1 port of the clock_gen core to feed the XPLL of the TX core. The PLL input clock that feeds the TX core
is driven through the BUFG and then passed to the bank0_pll_clkin port. An XPIO bank has 54 pins, and the design uses 34 pins in the form of 16 pairs of data pins and one pair of transmit clock/strobe via the clock forwarding pins. The design constrains the ports for the transmit interfaces and the placement is taken care of by the Vivado tools.

<h2>Block Design with Versal CIPS to generate the PDI</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

In order to generate the PDI for a Versal device, the design needs to be built with the Control, Interfaces, and Processing Systems (CIPS) IP.
CIPS is the software interface around
the Versal processing system. The Versal family consists of a system-on-chip (SoC) style integrated
processing system (PS) and a programmable logic (PL) unit, NoC, and AI Engine providing an extensible
and flexible SoC solution on a single die. In the Versal ACAP SOC architecture, the ILA and
VIO IPs require a debug hub IP in order to function. This debug hub IP must in turn be connected to
the CIPS processor. A few additional blocks provide necessary clocking, reset, and NOC connectivity required for the debug IP to operate correctly.

<h2>Top-Level using TX and RX Advanced I/O Wizard Cores</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

The top-level design file (toplevel_sb.sv) includes the toplevel_sb module. This module
helps connect the interfaces such as clocks, debug ports, and I/O ports with the appropriate
sources. The top-level design houses the instantiation of both the RX and TX cores. To test
the design, the PRBS patterns from the custom PRBS generator provided in the design suite can
be used to generate and check the received data.

The PRBS generator generates 8-bit data for each pair of pins and feeds it to the TX core, which
in turn transmits it through the TX pins. The PRBS generator also houses an error injecting
mechanism. The data is received on the I/O ports of the RX core through an external loopback card.
The RX core forwards the deserialized data through the PHY to the programmable logic. This
deserialized data is then fed into the PRBS checker to check for any failures.

The top-level design file includes a constraints file (toplevel_sb.xdc). This file is used to
create clocks for the design, assign locations or pins to all the I/O ports in the design, and set
attributes if needed. The reference design constrains the design to optimally support high data
rates. The user must constrain the TX and RX ports. The Vivado tools can assign the XPHY
nibbles to the XPHY sites. The Advanced I/O Planner should be used to help with pin assignments
(see Advanced I/O Wizard LogiCORE IP Product Guide (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/advanced_io_wizard/v1_0/pg320-advanced-io-wizard.pdf">PG320</a>)) when using the AIOW. This tutorial uses prebuilt hardware in the form of the external loopback card. Thus, the I/O locations are provided in the XDC file.

<h2>Hardware Execution of the Design</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

This design uses the FMC XM107 Loopback Card. This card provides hard-wired loopback connections.
Thirty-four sets of differential pair nets LA[00:16]_P/N are looped one-to-one to LA[17:33]_P/N.
These loops are direct-connect. Refer to the FMC XM107 Loopback Card User Guide (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/ug539.pdf">UG539</a>). Following is the table from the FMC XM107 Loopback Card User Guide which highlights the loopback connections on the card.
The XM107 loopback card goes on connector J51 on the VCK190 platform for this design.

This design has been tested with a xcvc1902-vsva2197-2MP-e-S Versal device.
In the reference design, bank 706 is used for the TX core, and bank 707 is used for the RX core.
Refer to the VCK190 Schematics (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/design-license.html?cid=1b472a7f-089f-495e-97cb-68bcb4cceec8&filename=vck190-schematic-xtp610.zip">XTP610</a>). The pin assignments mentioned in the
constraints file (toplevel_sb.xdc) take care of these available loopback connections. The transmit
clock is sent on BD23 and BD24, which loops back as the capture clock on BB16 and BC16.

At this point, all the files are added to the project, and both the RX and TX cores are generated.
The design is ready to be synthesized and implemented. After the design has been implemented without any errors, build
the device image to generate a PDI to run on the hardware.

Before programming the PDI, make sure the power rail VADJ_FMC shows a reading of 1.5V. This ensures that the FMC card is operational. DS26 is the status LED on the board for VADJ_FMC.
If VADJ_FMC is not set to the correct value, or the DS26 status LED is not green, follow the workaround below.
Download the VCK190 Software Install and Board Setup Tutorial (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html#documentation">XTP619</a>) and VCK190 Board Interface Test (BIT) Tutorial (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html#documentation">XTP613</a>). Install the UART drivers by following the "UART Driver Install" section in the VCK190 Software Install and Board Setup Tutorial (<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck190.html#documentation">XTP619</a>).
Make sure to follow the appropriate steps under "Hardware Setup." The baud rate needs to be set to 115200, otherwise, the COM port displays all garbled characters.
Follow the steps under "Terminal Setup." This tutorial was tested using the USB-C cable (JTAG Boot mode).
Make sure this cable is the only one connected to the desktop being used. After the system controller firmware boots up on the appropriate COM port, use the command:
<b>nohup /usr/bin/boardframework.sh</b>.

</p>

After the COM port displays DONE, close the COM Port. At this time all the COM ports should be closed.
Follow the steps under "VCK190 Board Interface Test Setup." Navigate to the directory which has the executable BoardUI.exe.

Launch BoardUI.exe and click **OK**.

</p>

These steps should ensure that the VADJ_FMC power rail is set to the correct value. This workaround is needed each time the board is power-cycled.
This workaround might not be needed in future versions of the System Controller firmware.

After VADJ_FMC is correctly set, use the Hardware Manager from the Vivado tools to program the PDI and the probes file (.ltx). Upon programming, the VIO window appears, through which you can set the necessary resets to all the cores and the error injections
for PRBS Generator and Checker. The ILA window can be used to check the status signals and the data. To reset the board using the VIO output signals, follow the sequence below:

1. Set int_prbs_gen_rst to 1.
2. Set int_prbs_chk_rst to 1.
3. Set int_rx_rst to 1.
4. Set int_pll_rst_pll_rx to 1.
5. Set int_tx_rst to 1.
6. Set int_pll_rst_pll_tx to 1.

This should clear all the pll_locked, intf_rdy, and PRBS gen/chk signals. To set all the status signals again, release the resets by following the sequence below:

1. Set int_pll_rst_pll_tx to 0.
2. Set int_tx_rst to 0.
3. Set int_pll_rst_pll_rx to 0.
4. Set int_rx_rst to 0.
5. Set int_prbs_chk_rst to 0.
6. Set int_prbs_gen_rst to 0.

This should release all the resets, and the design is operational. In order to inject the error, set int_inject_err to 1. This should set the error flag int_prbs_err_all_sync. Alternatively, use the script reset_sb.tcl on the TCL console.

<h2>Simulation</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

The reference design uses the toplevel_testbench_sb.sv file to create a simple test
bench. This test bench connects the TX core to the RX core via loopback<num> connections
(wires). The transmit clock is transmitted on loopback13 and loopback14 loopback wires. All the
other loopback connections are used to transmit and receive the data. The clock-to-data
relationship is center aligned as shown in the following figure captured from the simulation.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://gitenterprise.xilinx.com/IPSP/Tutorials/blob/master/IO_Design/Single_bank_source_synchronous_design/Images/Center_Alignment.png" height="500">
</p>    

The top-level file (toplevel_sb.sv) highlights the lines which would need to be uncommented and commented in order
to simulate the design. The test bench provides the necessary clock and resets to the design and triggers its operation.
The PLL input clock is provided at 4.444 ns (225 MHz) to the RX and TX cores. The transmit/capture clock toggles at 900 MHz (1.111 ns period) as shown in the following figure. Because the
system is double data rate, the interface operates at 1800 Mb/s.

<h3>Simulating the Design</h3>

The design is tested with the Vivado Simulator 2020.2. This section describes how to launch the
simulation. Assuming the Vivado project is already created for the design, follow these steps to
simulate the design:

1. Under Simulation Sources, right click toplevel_testbench_sb.sv and select **Set as Top**.
Then, under Simulation from the Flow Navigator, click **Run Simulation**.

2. From the listed options, select **Run Behavioral Simulation**. This elaborates the design and
launches the simulation. Add desired signals such as intf_rdy, pll_locked, and int_prbs_err* to the waveform.

3. The run time for the simulation is 1 ns by default. It takes about 230 μs for the intf_rdy to be
asserted for the RX core, which indicates that the Built In Self Calibration process has completed and
the interface is ready for operation. Only after its assertion and the next Prbs_Valid should the data be
compared. Consequently, launch the simulation for a duration of more than 230 μs using the
box highlighted in the following figure. If necessary, add any additional signals to the waveform.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://gitenterprise.xilinx.com/IPSP/Tutorials/blob/master/IO_Design/Single_bank_source_synchronous_design/Images/Simulation_Time.png" height="500">
</p>    

4. After the behavioral simulation is finished, check for any errors by observing error flags for
the PRBS generator and checker. For example, int_prbs_err<num> reports the errors for each
instantiation of the PRBS generator and checker. The int_prbs_err24 denotes the error flag for
the PRBS module instantiated for NIBBLE[2], NIBBLESLICE[4]. Although the ports are named Tx_data_n0_bs2_p, this does not necessarily mean that they would map to NIBBLE[0], NIBBLESLICE[2].
Refer to the schematics to check the exact mapping of any pin in the design. Similarly,
Int_prbs_err_00 denotes the error for any NIBBLESLICEs on NIBBLE[2]. Int_prbs_err_12 denotes
the error for any NIBBLESLICEs on NIBBLE[1] and NIBBLE[2]. Int_prbs_err_all denotes an error on any NIBBLESLICEs across all the nibbles.

<h2>Script</h2>
<details>
   <summary>Click to expand</summary>

This section describes the script to build the design using Versal_ssync_rxtx_intrfce_sb.tcl. This design was built on
a machine with Linux OS. If running on Windows OS, there is a restriction with regard to the longest path. The user must make sure the
project directory is located close to the C:/ drive (hierarchically, the project directory should be under the C:/ drive). Also, change the
name of the directory Single_bank_source_synchronous_design in this tutorial to a shorter name. Change the name of the variable
_xil_proj_name_ (variable that sets the name of the project) in the script to a shorter name.
This script builds the design by adding all the source files, and adding and configuring the IP cores in the design.
The script also launches the synthesis and implementation.

In order to run the script, make sure it is placed beside the Design, Constraints, and Simulation directories. Launch the Vivado tools, and in the TCL console, run the command:
<b>source ./Versal_ssync_rxtx_intrfce_sb.tcl</b>.

It takes a few minutes for the script to build and implement the design.
