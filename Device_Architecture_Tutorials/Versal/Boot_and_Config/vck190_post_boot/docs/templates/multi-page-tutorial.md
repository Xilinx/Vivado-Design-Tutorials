# Introduction

Provide an introduction to your tutorial here. This should briefly describe what the tutorial does, what products/devices it relates to, and any other introductory information.

**Note**: If your tutorial is simple or straightforward and is expected to be done in one session, you should not use this template. Use the [Simple Tutorial Template](simple-tutorial-template.md) instead.

# Before You Begin

Provide any prerequisite content here. You could use a simple bulleted list, or have a subheading for each of the subsections.

For example, it might include:
* Installing required software
* Setting up required hardware
* Accessing labs or other files
* Other important information that the user needs before starting the tutorial.

## *Example Section*: Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files

1. To access the reference files, type the following into a terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials`.
2. Navigate to the `my-first-program` directory, and then access the `reference-files` directory.

# Lab or Section Headings

Provide a list of the included sections here, with links to the individual markdown files.
The below paragraphs are examples of ways you can introduce and link to the included sections.

## Example 1

This tutorial includes the following labs:
* [Lab 1](docs\section-template.md) - description of lab. Include any prerequisites here.
* [Lab 2](docs\section-template.md) - description of lab. Include any prerequisites.

**Note**: If the labs build on each other, use a numbered list here instead of bullets.

## Example 2

This tutorial includes the following labs:

### Lab 1
Include here a detailed description or introduction to the lab. Include any prerequisites or additional required steps.

### Lab 2
Include here a detailed description or introduction to the lab. Include any prerequisites or additional required steps.

## Using Headings for Tutorials with Multiple Labs
A tutorial lab is a set of instructions to complete a standalone task. This can be as simple or elaborate as needed, but it should encompass an overall task that a user would do in one session. Labs can build on each other or be done independently of each other.

To set up the structure for a tutorial with multiple labs, you will use headings to separate the labs and sub-headings to identify the steps and substeps within that lab.

Use first-level headings to name the lab, and follow it with an introductory paragraph about what the user will accomplish with that lab.

## Requirements
* Use a straightforward title for each heading to identify what the user goal is for that section. Use gerunds (verbs ending in -ing) to identify the goal of the lab or section. For example, say "Setting Up Your Board" instead of "Board Setup."
* Use "title case" capitalization for all headings. See [Title Case Capitalization](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case) for more information.

## Best Practices

* You can number labs if they are to be done in order.
* If one lab builds on another, include that information in the introduction.  
Optionally, if a file or other output from one lab is required to start another, you can provide these in a subfolder to allow the user to start a later lab without completing the prerequisite one.

# Next Steps

Use this optional section to provide information about any next steps the user can or should take.
This could include links to other tutorials.

# References

Use this optional section to provide links to additional reference materials.
