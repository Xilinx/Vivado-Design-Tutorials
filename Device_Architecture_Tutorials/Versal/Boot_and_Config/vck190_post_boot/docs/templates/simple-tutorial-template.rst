Introduction
============

Provide an introduction to your tutorial here. This should briefly describe what the tutorial does, what products/devices it relates to, and any other introductory information.

Before You Begin
================

Provide any prerequisite content here. You could use a simple bulleted list, or have a subheading for each of the subsections.

For example, it might include:

- Installing required software
- Setting up required hardware
- Accessing labs or other files
- Other important information that the user needs before starting the tutorial.

*Example Section*: Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files
---------------------------------------------------------

1. To access the reference files, type the following into a terminal:

   .. code::

      git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials

2. Navigate to the ``my-first-program`` directory, and then access the ``reference-files`` directory.

Lab Headings
============

Provide the steps for the lab. The lab structure should be as follows.

.. note:: If your tutorial is simple or straightforward and is expected to be done in one session, you do not need to break it into labs.

Using Headings for Tutorials with Multiple Labs
-----------------------------------------------

A tutorial lab is a set of instructions to complete a standalone task. This can be as simple or elaborate as needed, but it should encompass an overall task that a user would do in one session. Labs can build on each other or be done independently of each other.

To set up the structure for a tutorial with multiple labs, you will use headings to separate the labs and sub-headings to identify the steps and substeps within that lab.

Use first-level headings to name the lab, and follow it with an introductory paragraph about what the user will accomplish with that
lab.

Requirements
------------

-  Use a straightforward title for each heading to identify what the user goal is for that section. Use gerunds (verbs ending in -ing) to identify the goal of the lab or section. For example, say “Setting Up Your Board” instead of “Board Setup.”
-  Use “title case” capitalization for all headings. See `Title Case Capitalization <https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case>`_ for more information.

Best Practices
--------------

-  You can number labs if they are to be done in order.
-  If one lab builds on another, include that information in the introduction. Optionally, if a file or other output from one lab is required to start another, you can provide these in a subfolder to allow the user to start a later lab without completing the prerequisite one.

Next Steps
==========

Use this optional section to provide information about any next steps the user can or should take. This could include links to other tutorials.
