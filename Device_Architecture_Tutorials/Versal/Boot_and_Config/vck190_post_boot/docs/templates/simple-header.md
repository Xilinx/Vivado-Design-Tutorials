# Title

Markdown files are organized with headings, which use a hash sign in front of text (such as `# Title`). Markdown files must have one, and **only one**, `# Heading` at level 1. All other headings must use two or more hash signs (`##`).

## Heading level 2

This is an example of a subsequent usage of a heading.

## Footer

At the end of Markdown files, you must include a footer that contains required licensing information. For example:

<p class="sphinxhide" align="center"><sup><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/copyright">Terms and Conditions</a></sup></p>
