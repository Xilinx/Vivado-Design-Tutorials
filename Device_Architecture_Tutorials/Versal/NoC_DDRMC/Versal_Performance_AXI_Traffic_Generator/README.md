# The Versal NoC Performance AXI Traffic Generator
The Performance AXI Traffic Generator is intended for modeling traffic masters in Versal™ ACAP designs for performance evaluation of network on chip (NoC) based solutions. It is available in two versions: Non-Synthesizable for simulations only and Synthesizable for both simulations and running in the hardware. The traffic generator supports AXI3, AXI4, and AXI4-Stream protocols. The traffic generator supports multiple operating modes and offers high level of configuration options to support the dynamic workloads enabled by Versal ACAP devices. The IP documentation is available in PG381.

These labs will focus on AXI4MM use cases with both the Non-Synthesizable and Synthesizable Performance AXI Traffic Generators. The Non-Synthesizable Performance AXI Traffic Generator tutorial has three labs which are all focused on simulation only use cases. The Synthesizable Performance AXI Traffic Generator tutorial has four labs which start in simulation and end with running a design in hardware.  Both sets of tutorials assume Vivado 2021.2 is used with a VCK190 board and targeting the 3200 Mbps DDR4 DIMM interface.

To begin the exercises, select either the Non-Synthesizable_Traffic_Generator or Synthesizable_Traffic_Generator folder above.
