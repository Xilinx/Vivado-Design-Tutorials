# Lab 1 - Introduction to the Performance AXI Traffic Generator

This tutorial covers the basics of building a synthesizable performance AXI traffic generator design. This lab leverages the default CSV traffic specification to demonstrate a simple AXI traffic generator simulation on a VCK190 evaluation board. The lab walks through the steps to build a design with various IP components in IP Integrator.  Additionally, instructions are included on how to configure and connect the various IP components in order to have a working design in simulation.  The design uses a basic 64-bit DDR4 memory interface running at 3200Mbps which is accessible through an AXI NoC instantiation.

# Description of the Design

This design targets the VCK190 evaluation board and uses a single Performance AXI traffic generator instantiation to drive traffic to an AXI NoC instance with a 64-Bit 3200 Mbps DDR4 interface. The traffic pattern leverages the default CSV file but is modified to have larger aligned memory accesses and less write/read transactions to reduce the simulation run time. Little automation is used to build the project in order to reinforce the design process.

# Building the Design

1. Create a working directory called pg381_synth_tg_labs.
1. Create the Project.
    * Open Vivado Design Suite and click on Create Project.
    * Press Next.
    * Name the project Lab_1, set within the pg381_synth_tg_labs folder, and press Next.
    * Select RTL Project and press Next.
    * Press Next twice to skip adding Sources and Constraints.
    * At the Default Part screen select the Boards option, target the Versal VCK190 Evaluation Platform, then press Next.
    * Press Finish at the final screen.
1. At the Flow Navigator screen select the option to Create Block Design under the IP INTEGRATOR heading.
    * Press OK at the Create Block Design prompt.
1. Add the AXI NoC.
    * Right click on the IPI Canvas and select Add IP to bring up the IP Catalog.
    * Type AXI NoC in the search field and then double click on the AXI NoC to add it to the canvas.
    * After the AXI NoC is placed on the canvas select the Run Block Automation option at the top of the canvas.
    * Leave the automation options as the defaults with a Control, Interface, and Processing System instantiation (CIPS), no AXI Traffic Generator, no External Sources, no AXI BRAM Controller, and a single DDR memory controller instance.
    * ![Run Block Automation](images/axi_noc_block_automation_for_vck190_early_steps.jpg)
    * The block automation adds the CIPS presets for the VCK190 board as well as targeting the DDR4 interface on the board.  Automation also enables the Cache Coherent interfaces on the CIPS block which are connected to the AXI NoC.  This allows the lab to be imported to Vitis as a valid project which can be expanded upon.
1. Exploring the NoC.
    * Double click on the AXI NoC to bring up the configuration GUI.
    * The Board tab shows the VCK190 board aware interfaces with CH0_DDR4_0 connected to ddr dimm1 and the DDRMC reference clock sys_clk0 connected to ddr4 dimm1 sma clk.
    * The General tab shows 6 AXI Slave interfaces which were connected by automation.  It also has 6 AXI clocks to correspond with each AXI Slave interface.  A Single Memory Controller is enabled with 4 Memory Controller Ports.  The default address ranges of DDR LOW0 and DDR LOW1 are set.
    * The Inputs tab shows the 6 AXI slaves and their clock domain.
    * Nothing is connected in the Outputs tab.
    * The Connectivity tab shows the AXI Slave to MC Port connection matrix.

    * Right click on the canvas and select Regenerate Layout.
    * ![Final IPI Canvas](images/ipi_canvas_final_connections.jpg)
1. Assign S06_AXI.
    * At the top of the IPI Canvas select the Address Editor tab, and then press the down arrow button to 'Assign All' remaining segments.
    * This figure shows the original address mapping before 'Assign All'.
    * ![Before Auto Assign Address](images/address_editor_before.jpg)
    * This figure shows the addressing after 'Assign All'.
    * ![Final Auto Assign Address](images/address_editor_after.jpg)
    * Note now the /perf_axi_tg_0/Data segment is assigned to C1_DDR_LOW0 and C1_DDR_LOW1, which corresponds to MC Port 1 of the DDR_LOW0 and DDR_LOW1 memory ranges.
1. Go back to the IPI Canvas by selecting the Diagram tab.
    * Right click on the M_AXI channel of the perf_axi_tg_0 and select Mark Simulation.
1. Under the Sources tab expand the Design Sources heading, right click on design_1.bd, and select Create HDL Wrapper...
    * Leave it as 'Let Vivado manage wrapper and auto-update' then press OK
    * ![Create Wrapper](images/create_wrapper.jpg)
1. After the wrapper is created select the Generate Block Design option under the IP INTEGRATOR tab of the Flow Navigator.
    * When prompted select Global under Synthesis Options and press Generate.
    * Note that the Generate Block Design step runs validation checks on user CSV files assigned to the Performance AXI Traffic Generators.
    * ![Global Output Products](images/global_output_products.jpg)
1. Copy the default CSV file to the project.
    * The default CSV file path can be seen here:
    * Xilinx\Vivado\2021.2\data\ip\xilinx\perf_axi_tg_v1_0\utils
    * The default_aximm_synth_tg.csv file is used for AXI4MM based designs.
    * The default_axis_synth_tg.csv file is used for AXI Stream based designs.
    * Copy the default_aximm_synth_tg.csv file in to the Lab_1 project folder.
    * Rename the default_aximm_synth_tg.csv file to synth_tg_lab_1.csv.
    * Open the CSV file.
    * The default CSV file issues 5000 Writes and then 5000 Reads starting at address 0x0 with a burst length of 0 and a burst size of 0, meaning 1 burst of 1 byte per command, with the AXI burst type set to 1 for INCR.  This is not a realistic DDR4 access pattern so the axi_len and axi_size fields will be updated.  Additionally 5000 commands will result in a longer simulation run time, so this will also be reduced.
    * ![Default CSV File](images/default_csv_file.jpg)
        *  Right click and select Open Image, or View Image, or Save Image to see in high quality.
    * Change the axi_len field to 0x3 for an AXI burst length of 4.
    * Change the axi_size field to 0x6 for 64Bytes, which aligns to a 64-bit DDR4 interface burst size.
    * Change the txn_count/loop_count/wait_option from 5000 to 500 to reduce simulation run time.
    * ![Lab 1 Modified CSV File](images/lab_1_modified_csv_file.jpg)
        *  Right click and select Open Image, or View Image, or Save Image to see in high quality.
    * Save the changes and close the file.
    * For more information about the CSV fields see PG381.
1. Target the new CSV file to the Performance AXI Traffic Generator.
    * Click on the Open Block Design on the left side of the Vivado GUI and select the Diagram tab to return to the IPI canvas.
    * Double click on the Perf AXI TG on the IPI Canvas.
    * Go to the Synthesizable TG Options tab.
    * Click on the folder icon next to the Path to User Defined Pattern File (CSV) for Synthesizable TG.
    * Navigate to synth_tg_lab_1.csv in the Lab_1 project structure, select the file, and press OK.
    * Press OK again to close the customization GUI.
1. Press Generate Block Design again with the Global outputs options.
    * The resulting CSV file after it was processed can be seen in this path:
    * Lab_1\Lab_1.gen\sources_1\bd\design_1\ip\design_1_perf_axi_tg_0_0\design_1_perf_axi_tg_0_0_synth_pattern.csv
    * Open the CSV file and see that the axi_len, axi_size, and txn_count/loop_count/wait_option fields are all updated.

# Simulating the Design

1. After generation is complete, update the Simulation settings.
    * Right click on the Simulation heading in the Flow Navigator column and select Simulation Settings.
    * Go to the Simulation tab.
    * Set the xsim.simulate.runtime to 1ms.
    * Check the box for xsim.simulate.log_all_signals.
    * Press Apply then press OK.
    * ![Simulation Settings](images/simulation_settings.jpg)

1. Run the simulation by left clicking on the Run Simulation button, then Run Behavioral Simulation.
    * The simulation will run and will automatically finish after the 500 Writes and 500 Reads are complete.
1. View the results by selecting the Untitled tab.
    * Press the maximize window button in the upper right corner.
    * Right click in the simulation window and select the Full View option.
    * Expand the simulation channels until you can see the Read Address and Write Address busses.
    * ![Simulation Results](images/simulation_results.jpg)
    * Notice how the AXI Address move linearly through the address space with 0x100 Byte offsets, which aligns with 4 bursts of 64 Bytes per command.
    * Also note that for most of the simulation time the Write and Read traffic is mixed but there is a period of Read only traffic after the Writes have completed.

# Export Design Files

1. Export the Block Design.
    * Go back to the Block Design by selecting the Open Block Design tab under the Flow Navigator columns.
    * Go to File, Export, then Export Block Design.
    * Change the file name to pg381_synth_tg_lab_1.tcl.
    * ![Export Block Design](images/export_block_design.jpg)
    * Use this file to rebuild this project for Lab 2.
1. Modify the Block Design TCL script.
    * Navigate to the pg381_synth_tg_lab_1.tcl and open in a text editor.
    * Search for this line:
    CONFIG.USER_SYNTH_DEFINED_PATTERN_CSV
    * Change the file path to only have the CSV file, as follows:
      * CONFIG.USER_SYNTH_DEFINED_PATTERN_CSV {synth_tg_lab_1.csv} \
    * This change allows for the CSV file to be automatically picked up when rebuilding the block design.
1. Save a project archive.
    * Go to File, Project, and then Archive.
    * Name the archive Lab_1, check the box for Include configuration settings, and then press OK to generate the archive.
    * ![Archive Project](images/project_archive.jpg)
    * It is safe to ignore the Critical Warnings during the archiving process if they appear.
