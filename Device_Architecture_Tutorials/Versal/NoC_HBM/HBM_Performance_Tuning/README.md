# NoC HBM Performance Tuning

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide for optimizing designs for peak performance with HBM subsystems. It presents a systematic approach to modeling the NoC, HBM controllers, and Performance AXI Traffic Generators with the goal of defining and achieving specific performance targets. The step-by-step tuning explained in this tutorial spans across multiple modules, covering concepts such as QoS, connectivity, transaction parameters, and address mapping. By following this guide, system designers can effectively improve the performance of their memory subsystems, ensuring efficient utilization of HBM across diverse applications.

The designs in this tutorial are built using ***Vivado 2024.1***.

## Module 01 - QoS and Connectivity

This module provides a range of example designs to impart knowledge of the performance tuning process involving NoC connectivity and quality of service (QoS).

## Module 02 - Address mapping

This module examines the impact of various traffic patterns on the performance of the HBM subsystem and explores the different address mappings for possible performance improvements.
