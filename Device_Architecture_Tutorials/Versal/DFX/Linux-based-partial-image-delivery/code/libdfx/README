PetaLinux User Application Template
===================================

This directory contains a PetaLinux user application created from a template.

If you are developing your application from scratch, simply start editing the
file libdfx-app.c.

You can easily import any existing application code by copying it into this 
directory, and editing the automatically generated Makefile.

Before building the application, you will need to enable the application
from PetaLinux menuconfig by running:
    "petalinux-config -c rootfs"
You will see your application in the "apps --->" submenu.

To build your application, simply run "petalinux-build -c libdfx-app".
This command will build your application and will install your application
into the target file system host copy.

You will also need to rebuild PetaLinux bootable images so that the images
is updated with the updated target filesystem copy, run this command:
    "petalinux-build -c rootfs"

You can also run one PetaLinux command to install the application to the
target filesystem host copy and update the bootable images as follows:
    "petalinux-build"

To add extra source code files (for example, to split a large application into 
multiple source files), add the relevant .o files to the list in the local 
Makefile where indicated.
